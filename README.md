 # An Analysis of inflation rate in Nigeria from 2008 to 2024

 ### Project Overview

 This project provides insights into the inflation rate in Nigeria since 2008, analyzing its effects on key macroeconomic variables, the contributing factors behind inflationary trends, and how these dynamics have impacted the average Nigerian. The analysis also explores the correlation between inflation and sectors such as food, healthcare, and transportation, offering a comprehensive view of the underlying economic challenges .

 ### Data source

 Kaggle [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamhardy/nigeria-inflation-rates)

 ### Methodology

- Data Loading: Imported necessary libraries from Google Drive and read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- Data Inspection: Reviewed the datasetâ€™s structure, checked formats, and examined data types. Made appropriate type conversions to ensure consistency.
- Data Cleaning: Verified the dataset for missing values; confirmed that no cleaning was required as the data was already complete.
- Data Analysis: Proceeded to explore the dataset through statistical analysis and visualizations, focusing on inflation trends and their relationships with key macroeconomic variables.

### Tools used
Python

### Libraries 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Key insights
The analysis revealed that all macroeconomic variables examined share a positive relationship with inflation. As inflation rises, the cost of goods and services, education, healthcare, and other essential sectors also increase. However, each sector has its own unique relationship with the inflation rate. Notably, crude oil production and exports are negatively correlated with inflation, meaning that increased crude oil output and exports tend to reduce inflationary pressures. Over time, these dynamics have significantly impacted the standard of living in Nigeria, contributing to rising costs and socio-economic challenges, including insecurity.

## Policy Recomendations
To conclude this analysis, i'd like to  suggest a few points that would generally ease inflation rate leading to lower costs in all other major sectors.
 1. STABILIZATION OF THE EXCHANGE RATE - This would have a positive impact on all sectors because it would lead to lower cost of importing goods and services
 2. IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY - This improves affordability for consumers, reduces inflationary pressure, and boosts economic growth in related industries .
 3. REDUCING DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTS - Promoting local production of energy to help reduce the impact of global oil fluctuations .
 4. REFORMING FUEL SUBCIDIES - The removal of fuel subsidies has a direct impact on the transportation and logistics sectors, which heavily rely on fuel for moving
 goods and people. Gradual reform of subsidies can reduce the cost of doing business, making transportation and distribution more affordable and efficient .
 5. EXPANDING SOCIAL SAFETY NETS - Expanded safety nets benefit sectors like healthcare and education, ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to essential services.
 These programs also stimulate demand for basic goods and services, benefiting the retail and agriculture sectors.
